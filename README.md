# Discontinued !
I appreciate the effort put in Godot but there are some issues that made me stop working with it:
- a scriptclass can only have one parent class, there is no multiple inheritance (for gods sake) but also not interfaces. Therefore oo-patterns cannot be fully applied.
- furthermore I get "cyclic-dependency" issues that makes it nearly impossible to write 2 classes that depend on each other ?!
- non-typesafe programming is encouraged which leads to errors at runtime instead at compiletime

# Barjob
This is my first game in GodotEngine V3.1 to learn how to make games there.

Its some kind of Waitress-simulation where you have to memorize the drink-orders from customers and deliver them correctly.
(some kind of memory game?)
